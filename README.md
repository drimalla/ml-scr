# Detecting empathy based on skin conductance data

The goal of this project was to predict empathy based on skin conductance data in a psychological experiment. I did this project in a machine learning class, when I was a Computational Science student. I used different machine learning classifier (e.g., CNNs) to differentiate between two types of empathy. Unfortunately, the project is not very well documented. If you have any questions about it, feel free to reach out to me.
