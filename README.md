# Detecting empathy based on skin conductance data

The goal of this project was to predict empathy based on skin conductance data in a psychological experiment. I used different machine learning classifier (e.g., CNNs) to differentiate between two types of empathy. I did this project in a machine learning class, when I was a Computational Science student. If you have any questions about it, feel free to reach out to me.
